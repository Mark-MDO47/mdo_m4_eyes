# mdo_m4_eyes
"fork" of https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides.git /M4_Eyes directory

I didn't want to fork the entire Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides so I am making a copy of the .../M4_Eyes directory and all subdirectories.

This Adafruit code is incredible! I just want to make some tiny customizations for personal use.

I am including the LICENSE from Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides - an MIT license.
- I am not trying to pretend to be approved by Adafruit in any way; I just want to ensure that all of the Adafruit license terms are respected in this "fork".
